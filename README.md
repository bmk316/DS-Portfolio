# DS-Portfolio

This portfolio consists of projects and workings as part of my journey in Data Science. Given that I am a novice coder, yet an experienced professional in the Business Analytics domain, I figured it's best to bridge that gap. This space will consist of work meant for helping me learn as well as for academic purposes, which will in turn hone my skills toward achieving the role of a Data Scientist.

This repository is therefore a work in progress and continual improvement will be noticed right from the first post.
