# DS-Portfolio

This portfolio (as well as other repos) consists of projects and workings as part of my journey in Data Science. Given my experience in the Business Analytics domain, I figured it's best to bridge that gap between BA and DS. This space will consist of work meant to help me learn on this joourney, as well as for academic purposes, which will in turn hone my skills toward achieving the role of a Data Scientist. Lot of these projects have been inspired by online tutorials and data science leaders.

This repository is therefore a work in progress and it will incorporate continual improvement.
